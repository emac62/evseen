        <p>Last updated: December 2020</p>
        <p>Welcome to EventsSeen (us, we, or our) which operates as EventsSeen (the Site). This page informs you of our
          policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from you as a user of
          this Site.</p>

        <h5>What Data is Collected?</h5>
        <p>When you create an account, we collect a user name, email address and password. To discourage inauthentic
          accounts, you will need to verify the email address before gaining access to the Site. Once your account has
          been
          activated, you are prompted to upload a profile photo and submit a first and last user name. The profile photo
          will be used by our Site for internal display purposes and only be visible to others using the Site. First
          Name/Last Names and profile photos may be visible on third party platforms for comments/discussions, as per
          your
          settings on those sites. We accept no responsibility for the privacy policies on those sites. Each user name
          is
          unique and may or may not contain personal information. This Site uses Cookies to allow for ease of use.</p>


        <h5>How is Data Collected?</h5>
        <p>Data is collected via the Registration Form, the Update Profile Form and the Add and Event Forms.</p>
        <p>When an account is created, an email is sent to the address given, indicating the creation. It will include a
          clickable link, to activate the account. This link will expire seven (7) days after it was sent. There are no
          other hidden devices that will scrape private information from your computer or email address. </p>
        <p>The same process is used when you change your password. We will send an encrypted token to you upon a
          password
          change request. We do not have access to your password once it has been changed. It will remain encrypted.</p>


        <h5>Purpose of Collected Data</h5>
        <p>We will use your information to verify your email address, to create and maintain user accounts and to send
          the
          occasional newsletter. We will not share or sell your data but we also take no responsibility for your privacy
          settings on any third party platform. It is important to EventsSeen that the Site is safe and honest for
          users. We
          will actively investigate and shut down accounts that are fraudulent or accounts that engage or promote
          illegal
          activities. </p>

        <h5>Controlling your Data</h5>
        <p>As the owner of your contributions, you can delete any post at any time. We will not keep a copy unless
          illegal
          activity is suspected or we are instructed to hold it, by legal authority. However, any moment can be gleaned
          by
          users taking a screenshot of the posts and we have no control over these actions. </p>
        <p>Users will also have the ability to delete their account and, with it, all data collected. </p>
        <h5>Changes To This Privacy Policy Statement</h5>
        <p>This Privacy Policy statement is effective as of December 2020 and will remain in effect except with respect
          to
          any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this
          statement. </p>
        <p>We reserve the right to update or change the Privacy Policy Statement periodically. Your continued use of
          this
          Site after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy Statement will constitute your acknowledgement and
          agreement to those changes. If we make any material changes to the Privacy Policy Statement, we will notify
          you
          either through the Site or by placing a prominent notice on our website. </p>
