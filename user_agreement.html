        <p>Welcome to <b><em>EventSeen</em></b> a social media website designed for sharing memories of exciting
          ticketed
          events.
        </p>
        <p>Please read this Agreement and Conditions (Agreement, Terms of Service, Terms) carefully before using the
          EventsSeen website (Site) operated by EventsSeen (us, we, our).</p>
        <p>Your (you, the user) access to and use of this site is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with
          this
          Agreement. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, contributors and others who access or use this Site. By
          accessing or using this Site, you agree to be bound by these Terms. By creating an account and using this
          Site,
          you have constituted an acceptance of these Terms. Should you use this Site and NOT abide by the Conditions
          (Rules), you forfeit your right to use the Site.</p>
        <p>By using EventsSeen, you are agreeing to the Privacy Policy Statement and this User Agreement. We reserve the
          right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will try to provide a minimum of 30 days notice prior
          to
          any material change.</p>
        <p>It is the intention of EventsSeen to use social media, including this one, to connect and interact with our
          users
          and subscribers in a respectful manner and we expect the same of each person to do the same. While other sites
          may
          be used to assist us, through posting or reposting, we accept no responsibility for information found on third
          party platforms. Furthermore, the endorsement of an individual post (by liking or reposting) does not indicate
          an
          endorsement of the platform. </p>
        <h5>Comments and Interactions</h5>
        <p>EventsSeen insists on respectful and polite statements and interactions on all parts of the Site. We want
          everyone to enjoy the experience of building knowledge around past ticketed events and we want everyone to
          feel
          safe sharing their memories. One person’s recollection may vary slightly from another’s. Be mindful when
          providing
          clarity or alternate perspectives. No one will ever be ‘perfectly’ right, so don’t try to be the authority.
        </p>
        <p>EventsSeen may respond to discussions where appropriate but we will not add to any discussions that are
          divisive,
          mean or hateful in any manner. Those who post material that may be construed as harassing or rude will find
          those
          posts flagged. Those flags will be visible to other users on your profile. Only EventsSeen can remove them. It
          is
          essential to this Site that internet safety is a primary concern. </p>
        <p class="mb-0">We further reserve the right to remove or block content that:</p>
        <ul class="ml-5 mb-2" style="list-style: disc;">
          <li>contains personal information</li>
          <li>expresses hatred based on sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, race, ethnicity, disability,
            economic status or age.</li>
          <li>encourages illegal activity</li>
          <li>threatens, harasses, intimidates, insults or defames</li>
          <li>advertises without written consent from EventsSeeen</li>
          <li>is unintelligible or irrelevant to a discussion</li>
          <li>otherwise violates the Canadian Charters of Rights and Freedoms</li>
        </ul>


        <h5>Content and Contributions</h5>
        <h6>Ownership</h6>
        <p>You are the sole owner of the content that you create under your account. We will not copy or change any
          content
          on your account without your expressed permission. While we are not responsible nor liable for the content
          created, we reserve the right to remove all inappropriate content that contravenes the Copyright Laws of
          Canada.
        </p>
        <h6>EventsSeen Rules</h6>
        <p>This is a social website meant to share authentic ticketed moments and, as such, will follow standard social
          mores. </p>
        <p class="mb-0">Explicitly:</p>
        <ul class="ml-5 mb-2" style="list-style: disc;">
          <li>use your real name and be proud to share your viewpoint. Don’t hide or pretend to be someone else.
            Accounts
            found to be inauthentic will be terminated</li>
          <li>be kind to others. Don’t diminish another person’s memory or experience. We are here to build on each
            other’s awesome moments</li>
          <li>no harassment. Attacking people in hopes of anonymity is not acceptable. This Site is for sharing and will
            not tolerate derogatory comments</li>
          <li>no violent, pornographic or sexually explicit images, links or content is allowed. Linking to an event to
            this type of negativity incites and frightens. It will be removed and your account will be flagged. Once an
            account has been flagged three times, it will be terminated</li>
          <li>no fake information. While we appreciate the nature of memory, the facts surrounding an event must not be
            changed to mislead or confuse. We encourage additional details and will remove what is factually untrue</li>
          <li>respect another person’s experience. As each moment is unique, so is one’s response to it. Stay on the
            topic
            of the event and avoid interactions that fixate on a person’s reaction. It is in our different perspectives
            that
            this website becomes powerful and exciting. Don’t kill the fun and keep a positive tone</li>
          <li>finally, EventsSeen uses a report and investigate algorithm. Comments and content that is meant to
            enflame,
            behaviour that harasses overtly or subtlety, and people identified as bad actors will be flagged. This flag
            is
            visible on a person’s profile page and can only be removed by EventsSeen. This allows the Website to alert
            users
            to a person’s past behaviour. When three flags are reached, the account will be shut down</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>User Account</h5>
        <p>As an account holder, you are solely responsible for maintaining privacy (user name and password). You are
          solely
          responsible for all interactions under that name and password. Accounts that do not adhere to the User
          Agreement
          will be terminated. </p>
